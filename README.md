# Debt Collection Analysis & ML Modeling
This Debt Collection Analysis Project uses SQL for data preparation and Python with machine learning models (regression and classification in Jupyter notebooks) to analyze debt collection outcomes from datasets like debtors, collectors, payments, and collection attempts.
This project explores debt collection data using SQL and Python for analysis, followed by building regression and classification machine learning models.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/`: SQL file to create dataset and tables.
- `notebooks/`: 
  - `01_data_analysis.ipynb`: Data cleaning and analysis.
  - `02_ml_models.ipynb`: Regression & classification models.
- `models/`: (Optional) Saved models.
- `utils/`: (Optional) Helper functions/scripts.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Tech
- MySQL
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Goals
- Understand patterns in debt collection data.
- Predict likelihood of recovery (classification).
- Estimate recovery amount (regression).
